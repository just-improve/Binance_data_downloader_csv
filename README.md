# Binance_data_downloader_csv
My program lets you download markets data from binance exchange to csv file. It lets you update existing files also. 
I prepare ohlcv data with volume divided to buy and sell. Also there is option to download ohlcv with open interests.
When you have files in project folder ohlcv_data or oi_data you can update all files in this directory by one click.
